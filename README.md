2) Forcing sleep during events. (Invasions, Blood Moon,  Solar Eclipse, Lunar Events, etc.)
3) Falling asleep immediately. (Closing the player's eyes.)
4) Using items or holding a fishing rod no longer causes the player to stop sleeping.
5) Sleeping/Sitting on the same bed/chair with another player.
6) Sleeping while sitting on a chair. (So why the fuck it is a mod "that makes your bed function better"?)
